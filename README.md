unit-threaded
=============

Unit test framework for D.

TODO:

- Integrate with built-in unittest blocks (catch AssertionError?)
- Add all tests in a list of packages automatically
- Use lazy expressions to get better failure messages
- Random reordering of tests in single-threaded mode?
- Split code to avoid bloat and decrease linking time?
